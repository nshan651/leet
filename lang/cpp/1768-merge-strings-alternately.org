https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return /the merged string/.

* Examples
** Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

** Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

** Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q
merged: a p b q c   d

* Constraints:

    1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

* Solution

#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :flags -I./src/util -std=c++20 :tangle src/1768-merge-strings-alternately.cpp
  #include <string>

      {
        res.push_back(word1[i]);
        res.push_back(word2[i]);
        i++;
      }

      // Merge remaining chars in word1
      while (i < word1.size())

      }
